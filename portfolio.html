          My professional experience covers 18 years of part-time work with Center for Pain handling all aspects of hardware and software installations and maintenance and technical support, along with remote access to quickly resolve issues. 
          Masterpiece Vintage Cars I have had 10 years of experience with installing Windows servers to house our websites and handle the local network for employees. At Masterpiece I also handled all technical and support issues internally and handled customer issues and questions about the classics that we have sold. In addition to the technical and support jobs, I also did all the photography of our classic cars, built and worked with all of the photographs to post to our website and all of our advertising venues. 
          My career has been instrumental in the improvement, streamlining and cost savings of these operations and my career progressed as a result.

        Choc-Ola® was an absolutely delicious chocolate beverage invented in 1944 by Harry Normington, Sr. and manufactured out of Indianapolis, IN until approximately 1985.

        Harry sold the company in 1977 and retired. The company that purchased Choc-Ola® continued to manufacture it at the Indianapolis facility until 1985. In 1985, it was acquired by another company who eventually phased it out of the marketplace.
        
        After that, Choc-Ola® sat idle for years and years - until one June day in 2009 when the owner of the Rock-Cola Cafe in Indianapolis was looking for something "throwback" to offer at his little '50s cafe. He subsequently stumbled upon the fact that Choc-Ola® was available and he set the wheels in motion to acquire the trademark rights.
        
        In 2010, he secured the trademark and began manufacturing it on a small-scale out of his cafe. However, he was barely able to keep up with the demand and so he began to actively look for a manufacturing partner.
        
        At the end of 2010, he entered into discussions with Prairie Farms to manufacture, bottle and distribute Choc-Ola®. By February of 2011, an agreement was reached, and simultaneously an agreement was reached with Martin's Super Markets, based out of South Bend, to be the first retail outlet.
        
        In 2012 he entered into discussions with Dairy Farmers of America to co-pack Choc-Ola in 12 oz shelf-stable cans. By the end of 2012, the shelf-stable cans were pilot-tested and approved. Active sales of the 12 oz cans began in the fall of 2013 and online sales were made available in November 2013.
